A progressive web application that uses Scryfall's API to display Magic cards

## Mystical Tutor

This is a progressive web application (for real, it includes a manifest.json and service worker file and everything) designed to use [Scryfall's](https://scryfall.com/) API.
I'm not endorsed by Scryfall, of course, and this is not reeeaaally a serious project. 
To be honest, I'm mostly creating this to 

1. Get experience working with Javascript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Workbox, APIs, etc., etc.
2. Have something to put on my resume so I can finally get hired

This also isn't intended to replace Scryfall (if that wasn't already obvious). It's basically just a proof of concept.
Planned changes include

- Better looking, more responsive layout
- Implementation of [Andrew Gioia's MTG mana symbol pictographic font thingy](https://github.com/andrewgioia/mana)
- Implementation of a limited search function (less robust than Scryfall's because I am just one human being and there are only so many hours in the day)
- Perhaps a search history?
- Find a replacement for Workbox if possible, mostly 'cause the general design of it and how it generates service worker files gives me the heebie-jeebies

But past that, I dunno. We'll see!
Help and suggestions are appreciated. 

Many thanks to Scryfall for their fantastic API and website.
Thanks to [@Saeris](https://github.com/Saeris/typeface-beleren-bold), and I suppose also Wizards of the Coast, for the Beleren Font.
Bootstrap has also been useful!
I used Google's Workbox thing, too. 

Uhhh yeah... that's it.
